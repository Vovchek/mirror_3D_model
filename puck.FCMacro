# --- assume you already built your final solid as a Part.Shape ---
# for demo Iâ€™ll just use a cylinder:
shape = Part.makeCylinder(151.5, 50)   # radius 151.5 mm, height 50 mm

# --- 1. Create a Feature to hold the Shape ---
feat = doc.addObject("Part::Feature", "PuckFeature")
feat.Shape = shape

# --- 2. Create a PartDesign Body ---
body = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Body", "PuckBody")

# --- 3. Reparent the feature as BaseFeature of the Body ---
body.BaseFeature = feat

# --- 4. Recompute ---
doc.recompute()

# --- (optional) activate body for immediate GUI editing ---
doc.getObject("PuckBody").ViewObject.Document.setEdit(body)
